 Online-Bookstore Management System
 
The Online Bookstore Management System is a console-based application developed using pure Core 
Java concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Collections, and File Handling. The system 
aims to simulate an online platform where users can browse, purchase, and manage books without 
relying on any external frameworks or databases. Provides an automated solution to handle book 
inventory, user registration, and sales records efficiently. It serves as a mini e-commerce system built 
entirely in Java, demonstrating how fundamental programming principles can be used to design a 
complete management system.
