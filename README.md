## 📖 Overview

The **Online Bookstore Management System** is a console-based application developed using pure **Core Java** concepts such as:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Collections Framework**
- **File Handling**

This system simulates an online platform where users can **browse, purchase, and manage books** without relying on any external frameworks or databases.

It provides an automated solution to efficiently manage:

- 📚 **Book Inventory**
- 👤 **User Registration**
- 💰 **Sales Records**

Serving as a **mini e-commerce platform** built entirely in Java, it demonstrates how fundamental programming principles can be applied to design a complete and efficient management system.
