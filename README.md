# 📚 Online Bookstore Management System

**Overview**

The Online Bookstore Management System is a console-based application developed using pure **Core Java** concepts such as **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Collections**, and **File Handling**.  
The system simulates an online platform where users can browse, purchase, and manage books without relying on any external frameworks or databases.  

It provides an automated solution to handle **book inventory**, **user registration**, and **sales records** efficiently.  
This project serves as a **mini e-commerce system** built entirely in Java, demonstrating how fundamental programming principles can be used to design a complete management system.
